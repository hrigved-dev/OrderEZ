# OrderEZ
An android project


## Problem Statement

Designing and creating an Android Application to reduce miscommunication, reduce the ordering time and to make the ordering process at a food place a lot more efficient and hassel-free, when a group of people are involved.


## What is this project about?

We often find ourselves in a situation where the waiter at a particular restaurant has been waiting to note down the order, but the person who gives out the final order finds it difficult to cope up with the order of a large group which keeps changing. Also, the person who is running late, wants his food on time. Hence, to solve this real-life problem, we have come up with an Android application, OrderEZ, that make this process a lot more efficient and error free.
